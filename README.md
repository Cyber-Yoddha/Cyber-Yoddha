- 👋 Hi, I’m @Cyber-Yoddha aka Siddharth Shil.
I'm enthusiastic about safeguarding the digital world and ensuring the safety and protection of people, businesses, and governments as an ambitious cybersecurity expert. 
I'm presently looking for opportunities so that I can advance my knowledge and abilities in this quickly changing industry.
I have developed a strong foundation in computer networking, programming, and information security concepts throughout my scholastic and personal encounters.

Moreover, I can analyse complicated circumstances and spot potential security threats thanks to my critical thinking and problem-solving abilities.
Through my involvement in group initiatives and cooperation with various partners, I have also strengthened my communication and teamwork skills.

My personal brand centers on a commitment to learning, growth, and collaboration.
I am always eager to expand my knowledge and stay up-to-date with the latest trends and threats in cybersecurity. 
Additionally, I am a firm believer in the importance of teamwork and effective communication in achieving shared goals.

If you are looking for a dedicated and motivated entry-level cybersecurity professional, I would love to connect with you and explore potential opportunities. 
Thank you for considering my personal brand, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.
